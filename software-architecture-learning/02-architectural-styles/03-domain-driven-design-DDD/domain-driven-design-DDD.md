# Domain driven design (DDD)

**Quick Answer:**

Domain‑Driven Design (DDD) is a **software development approach** that focuses on modeling software around the **business domain**. It emphasizes collaboration with domain experts, creating a **ubiquitous language**, and structuring systems into **bounded contexts** to manage complexity.

# 📘 Complete Notes on Domain‑Driven Design (DDD)

## 📖 Definition

- **DDD** is an approach to software design that prioritizes **understanding the business domain** and reflecting it in the software model.
- Introduced by **Eric Evans** in his book *Domain‑Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software*.
- Goal: Align software closely with business needs, making systems more maintainable and adaptable.

* * *

## 🎯 Core Principles

- **Focus on the domain:** The business problem is the center of design.
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts.
- **Bounded Contexts:** Divide large systems into smaller, well‑defined boundaries.
- **Strategic Design:** High‑level organization of domains and contexts.
- **Tactical Design:** Detailed modeling using entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, and services.

* * *

## 🏛 Scope

- **System/enterprise level.**
- DDD is not just a coding technique; it guides **architecture, communication, and modeling** across teams.
- Works best in **complex domains** (finance, healthcare, insurance, logistics).

* * *

## ⚙️ Key Building Blocks (Tactical Patterns)

- **Entity:** Object with identity (e.g., Customer, Order).
- **Value Object:** Immutable, defined by attributes (e.g., Money, Address).
- **Aggregate:** Cluster of entities/objects treated as a unit (e.g., Order with OrderLines).
- **Repository:** Abstraction for data access.
- **Domain Service:** Encapsulates domain logic not naturally fitting into an entity.
- **Factory:** Creates complex objects/aggregates.

* * *

## 📚 Strategic Design Concepts

- **Bounded Context:** Defines clear boundaries for models; prevents ambiguity.
- **Context Map:** Shows relationships between bounded contexts (e.g., upstream/downstream).
- **Core Domain:** The most critical part of the business; deserves most investment.
- **Supporting/Subdomains:** Less critical areas, may use simpler solutions.

* * *

## ✅ Advantages

- Aligns software with business needs.
- Manages complexity through bounded contexts.
- Improves communication between developers and domain experts.
- Encourages clean, maintainable models.
- Supports long‑term evolution of systems.

* * *

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Steep learning curve; requires domain expertise.
- Overhead for small/simple projects.
- Requires strong collaboration between technical and business teams.
- Risk of over‑modeling if applied blindly.

* * *

## 📊 When to Use

- Complex domains with evolving business rules.
- Large organizations with multiple teams.
- Systems requiring long‑term maintainability and adaptability.
- Projects where business experts are available for collaboration.

* * *

## 🚫 When to Avoid

- Simple CRUD applications.
- Small projects with limited scope.
- Teams without access to domain experts.
- Environments where rapid prototyping is more important than deep modeling.

* * *

## 🛠️ Implementation in .NET & Azure

- **DDD + Clean Architecture:** Use layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, UI).
- **Repositories:** Implement with EF Core.
- **Aggregates:** Model business rules in domain layer.
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing:** Often combined with DDD for scalability.
- **Azure Services:** Event Grid for domain events, Cosmos DB for aggregates, Service Bus for messaging.

* * *

## 📖 Example: E‑Commerce Domain

- **Entities:** Customer, Order, Product.
- **Value Objects:** Address, Money.
- **Aggregate:** Order (with OrderLines).
- **Bounded Contexts:** Catalog, Ordering, Payment, Shipping.
- **Ubiquitous Language:** “Order,” “Reserve Stock,” “Payment Authorization.”

* * *

## 📌 Checklist for DDD Adoption

- [ ] Identify core domain and subdomains.
- [ ] Define bounded contexts.
- [ ] Establish ubiquitous language with domain experts.
- [ ] Model entities, value objects, aggregates.
- [ ] Implement repositories and services.
- [ ] Document context maps and domain events.
- [ ] Ensure collaboration between devs and business stakeholders.

* * *

**Summary:**

Domain‑Driven Design is a **strategic and tactical approach** to building complex systems. It emphasizes **business alignment, bounded contexts, and rich domain models**. Best suited for **large, complex domains**, but avoid in **simple CRUD apps** where overhead outweighs benefits.

Would you like me to also prepare a **visual context map diagram** (showing bounded contexts and their relationships) so you can add it to your Notion notes?
